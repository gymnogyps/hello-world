# hello-world
My hello world debut to the worlds of Federated Empire. Hello World is the
the classic declaration of welcome, interpreted for all the languages of the 
Fedorated Empire. The details were to follow after the welcome but the 
Empire failed before the worlds could be unified into a cohesive political
fortress.
